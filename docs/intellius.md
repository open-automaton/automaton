Scraping Intellius
==================

[Intellius](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/intelius) is the primary mover in creepy data siphoning companies... it started with a database the original author did not build, but imported from yahoo to microsoft (in a burst of incompetence, it even had a **named subdomain** at infospace), then rebuilt as a series of primitive personal information sites. Now they're a full blown persona vendor, like Axciom or Merlin(who used decades of your financial or mail order habits to assemble *their* data).

And *surprise* any of the companies who claim to remove you actually only remove you while you pay, then add you back to the lists when you don't. So you are **only** signing up to make the problem worse.

So if you're unable to submit 30 removal requests (~2 work days worth of work, per month), there's **literally** nothing you can do. Even worse if I create a startup to fight this abuse, The MoTo catalogs will come in with an exclusive agreement that prevents the user from leaving with a clean record or they'll actively deny any attempts to enhance users ability to remove themselves. So the product will only work as advertised prior to that.

So let's build something to fight this, in such a way it cannot be co-opted or bypassed.

Now that we're properly motivated, lets build a scraper(requires [automaton-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@open-automaton/automaton-cli)):

```bash
# fetch the full body of the form you are scraping
auto fetch https://www.intelius.com/people-search/ > search-form.html
# check the forms on the page
auto xpath "//form" search-form.html
# craft a selector which only selects the target form
auto xpath "//form[@name='people-search-form']" search-form.html
# select all the inputs you need to populate from this form
auto xpath "//form[@name='people-search-form']//input|//form[@name='people-search-form']//select" search-form.html
```
This results in:

```json
[
  '<input type="text" name="firstName" maxlength="30" value="" placeholder="Enter first name" class="validate">',
  '<input type="text" name="lastName" maxlength="30" value="" placeholder="Enter last name" class="validate">',
  '<input type="text" name="city" value="" placeholder="Enter city">',
  '<select class="state-select" name="state"> ... '
]
```
So now we have all the information we need about that form:

```xml
<go url="https://www.intelius.com/people-search/">
    <set form="people-search-form" target="firstName" variable="first"></set>
    <set form="people-search-form" target="lastName" variable="last"></set>
    <set form="people-search-form" target="city" variable="city"></set>
    <set form="people-search-form" target="state" variable="stateCode"></set>
    <go form="people-search-form">
        <set xpath="//section[@id='people']//div[@class='person']" variable="matches">
            <set xpath="//div[@class='name-and-address']/h4" variable="name"></set>
            <set xpath="//div[@class='name-and-address']//span[@class='phone']" variable="hasPhone"></set>
            <set xpath="//div[@class='name-and-address']//span[@class='education']" variable="hasPhone"></set>
            <set xpath="//div[@class='name-and-address']//div[@class='address']" variable="location"></set>
            <set xpath="//div[@class='name-and-address']//span[@class='display-age']" variable="age"></set>
            <![CDATA[more inputs farmed here]]>
        </set>
    </go>
    <emit variables="matches"></emit>
</go>
```

And because intellius uses cloudflare shenanigans to prevent you from scraping, you'll need to use the puppeteer engine.

Now reclaiming your own data is a little easier(or for that matter claiming someone elses, which shouldn't be legal, but is here in the US until we have an equivalent of the GDPR).
