=========================
A web scraping solution for ease of use, maintenance and (soonâ„¢) deployment. Compares favorably to the Kapow Katalyst(Now owned by Kofax).

Usage
-----
[TBD]


Roadmap
-------

Rewritten from Scratch so I could get rid of the GPL attribution.

This project started out as a formalization of a set of techniques I have been using to scrape the web for almost a decade now, but as it turned out the surprise CTO insisted on GPL and server configurations before realizing he had 4 sources to scrape once per quarter (AKA: they had no need for scrapers in the first place, much less a highly customized solution that runs on the interval many definitions break).

I have had no less than 5 people ask me recently about it, so it was worthwhile to update some even older code to replace the strip-mine ecosystem.

Testing
-----
The Mocha is still brewing

Enjoy,
